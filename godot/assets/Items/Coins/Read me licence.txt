Thank you a lot for supporting me and purchasing this asset. I hope you can use it well to 1up your game ;)



Legal terms short version:
You can remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially. You can credit me which is defently nice but not necessary.
Direct redistribution is not allowed because I kind of do that. 

And thats it. Enjoy.
